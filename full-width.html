    <p class="full-width">HELLO!</p>
    <p class="full-width">what are you reading?</p>
    <p class="full-width">are we nearly there yet, and if not, why not?</p>
    <p class="full-width">how much do I have to write before the text is so small that you can't read it?</p>
    <p class="full-width">oh, I see a whole lot more than that, I'll have to keep rambling on for a lot longer.
    However, I am pretty pleased with how simple this turned out to be, and that I can still remember how to do division.</p>
